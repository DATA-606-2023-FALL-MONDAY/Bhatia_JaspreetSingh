## 2. Background

**What is the Project about?**

The IPL Score Prediction project is an exciting endeavor that harnesses the power of data analytics and machine learning to forecast the outcomes of cricket matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL). In a cricket-crazy nation like India, where the IPL is a sporting phenomenon, this project aims to provide cricket enthusiasts and sports enthusiasts with a valuable tool to anticipate the scores of upcoming matches. By analyzing historical data, team performance, player statistics, and various other factors, this project seeks to offer accurate and insightful predictions, enhancing the excitement and engagement surrounding IPL matches. It blends technology and sports passion to bring fans closer to the heart of the game.


**Why does it matter?**

The IPL Score Prediction project matters significantly for several reasons. Firstly, it adds an extra layer of excitement and engagement for cricket fans by allowing them to make informed predictions about match outcomes. This enhances the overall viewing experience and fosters a sense of participation.

Moreover, from a sports analysis perspective, it can provide valuable insights into team strategies, player performances, and the impact of various factors on match results. These insights can be used by cricket teams, coaches, and analysts to make data-driven decisions and improve their game.

Additionally, it showcases the practical applications of data analytics and machine learning in the world of sports, highlighting their relevance and potential in various industries beyond cricket. Overall, the IPL Score Prediction project matters as it enriches the fan experience, informs sports strategy, and demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making.



**What are your research questions?**


I am going to build a machine learning model for predicting the score of the first innings in an IPL match . I am also checking if we can get correct observation if we include the powerplay overs in account.

## 4. Exploratory data and complete Analysis

**Data Loading and Inspection**

The data was loaded into a Pandas dataframe and analyzed using df.head(), df.shape, df.info() to understand rows, columns and data types.

Initial analysis shows 15 columns and 76014 rows representing ball-by-ball data from IPL matches. Relevant columns are mid, date, runs, wickets, overs, striker, non-striker and total runs.

**Missing Value Analysis**

Checked for missing values using df.isnull().sum() to count nulls in each column. No missing/null values were found.

**Summary Statistics**

Generated summary statistics using df.describe() on numeric columns like runs, wickets, overs and striker score. Helps understand the spread of values.

**Data Visualization**

Created histograms using df.hist() to visually analyze the distribution of numeric variables.

Also checked output of df.corr() to find correlations between input variable like runs, wickets and output variable total.

**Data Preprocessing**

Removed inconsistent teams and trimmed data only for overs >= 5 as initial game overs display more variability.

The preprocessed data had reduced rows for modeling.

## 5. Techniques and models

**Data Preparation**

The preprocessed data after initial EDA was used for model training. The relevant input features identified were:

- runs
- wickets
- overs
- striker score
- non-striker score
- The output variable was the total runs.

**Train Test Split**

Split the input and output data into 80:20 train and test sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split method for model evaluation.

**Model Selection**

Selected RandomForestRegressor as it works well for multiple regression problems and provides additional hyperparameters for tuning model complexity and performance.

Created the model instance and trained it on the train split input and output data.

**Model Evaluation**

Predicted target variable total runs on the test input data and evaluated model performance:

- R-squared score: 85%
- Custom accuracy metric: 92%
The high scores indicate good generalisation and fit.

Tested model with custom input values to correctly predict an output total.

**Conclusion**

The RandomForest model predicts IPL total runs with good accuracy. It can be further improved by adding more relevant data like batting team strengths, individual player performance etc.
